# Interest Simulator
Simple program which requires you and input with your credit budget, the price of the product you want to buy, and the number of payments you want to split the price into.
Then, it calculates interest despite of the number of payments, and tells you if your credit is enough for that payment.
This program is part of the CoderHouseÂ´s Vanilla JavaScript course.
